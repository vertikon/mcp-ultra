# MCP Ultra v21 - Application Lifecycle Management

## Overview
The MCP Ultra v21 application lifecycle management system provides comprehensive enterprise-grade lifecycle orchestration, health monitoring, SLO tracking, automated deployments, and operational procedures.

## Key Components

### 1. Lifecycle Manager (`internal/lifecycle/manager.go`)
- **Component orchestration** with priority-based startup/shutdown
- **State management** tracking application health and readiness
- **Event system** for lifecycle events and notifications  
- **Background monitoring** with configurable intervals
- **Metrics collection** integrated with telemetry
- **Graceful shutdown** with timeout handling

**Key Features:**
- Priority-based component startup (lower number = higher priority)
- Health state tracking (Initializing → Starting → Ready → Healthy/Degraded → Stopping → Stopped)
- Component failure handling with retry mechanisms
- Event history tracking with configurable retention
- Telemetry integration for operational metrics

### 2. Health Monitor (`internal/lifecycle/health.go`)
- **Comprehensive health checking** for all system components
- **HTTP endpoints** for health, readiness, and liveness probes
- **Dependency monitoring** with external service checks
- **Configurable thresholds** for degraded/unhealthy states
- **Health report persistence** and history tracking
- **Alert integration** with configurable cooldowns

**Health Endpoints:**
- `/health` - Detailed health report with component status
- `/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe

### 3. Deployment Automation (`internal/lifecycle/deployment.go`)
- **Multiple deployment strategies**: Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling, Recreate
- **Automated validation**: Configuration, images, and resources
- **Rollback capabilities** with automatic threshold-based triggers
- **Pre/post deployment hooks** for custom automation
- **Progress tracking** with detailed logging
- **Integration with Kubernetes** via kubectl commands

**Supported Strategies:**
- **Rolling**: Zero-downtime updates with configurable surge/unavailable settings
- **Blue/Green**: Complete environment switch with traffic routing
- **Canary**: Gradual rollout with metrics-based promotion
- **Recreate**: Simple stop-and-start deployment

### 4. Operations Manager (`internal/lifecycle/operations.go`)
- **Operation orchestration** with step-by-step execution
- **Worker pool** for concurrent operation processing
- **Operation history** and audit logging
- **Retry mechanisms** with configurable delays
- **Cancellation support** for long-running operations
- **Rollback capabilities** for failed operations

**Operation Types:**
- Maintenance, Upgrade, Scaling, Backup, Restore
- Diagnostics, Cleanup, Configuration, Security Patches

### 5. SLO Monitoring (`internal/slo/monitor.go`)
- **Service Level Objective tracking** with Prometheus integration
- **Error budget calculations** and burn rate monitoring
- **Multi-channel alerting** (Slack, Discord, Email, PagerDuty)
- **Real-time status monitoring** with configurable evaluation windows
- **Alert management** with silence rules and escalation policies

**Default SLOs:**
- API Availability (99.9%)
- API Latency P95 (< 500ms)
- gRPC Availability (99.9%)
- Database Availability (99.5%)
- Cache Hit Rate (90%)
- Task Processing Throughput (1000/min)
- Compliance Accuracy (99.9%)

## Integration with Main Application

The lifecycle management system is fully integrated into the main application (`cmd/mcp-model-ultra/main.go`) with:

1. **Component Registration**: All major services (Database, Redis, EventBus, Observability, Compliance) are registered as lifecycle components
2. **Health Checkers**: Built-in health checkers for PostgreSQL and Redis
3. **SLO Configuration**: Default SLOs automatically configured and monitored  
4. **Operation Executors**: Maintenance operations executor registered
5. **HTTP Endpoints**: Health and status endpoints exposed via HTTP router
6. **Graceful Startup/Shutdown**: Coordinated startup and shutdown sequences

## Configuration

Each component has comprehensive configuration options:

```go
// Lifecycle Manager Configuration
type Config struct {
    StartupTimeout       time.Duration
    ShutdownTimeout      time.Duration
    HealthCheckInterval  time.Duration
    MaxRetries          int
    RetryDelay          time.Duration
    GracefulShutdownTimeout time.Duration
    MaxEventHistory     int
    EnableMetrics       bool
    EnableTracing       bool
}

// Health Monitor Configuration  
type HealthConfig struct {
    CheckInterval     time.Duration
    CheckTimeout      time.Duration
    DependencyTimeout time.Duration
    DegradedThreshold  int
    UnhealthyThreshold int
    EnableHTTPEndpoint bool
    HTTPPort          int
    HTTPPath          string
    EnableAlerting     bool
    AlertThreshold     HealthStatus
    AlertCooldown      time.Duration
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

The lifecycle management system provides extensive monitoring:

### Metrics
- Component count and health status
- Startup/shutdown duration  
- Operation execution metrics
- SLO compliance tracking
- Health check success rates

### Logging  
- Structured logging with contextual information
- Operation audit trails
- Health state transitions
- Deployment progress tracking
- Error reporting with stack traces

### Tracing
- Distributed tracing for lifecycle operations
- Component startup/shutdown spans
- Health check execution traces
- Deployment pipeline tracing

## Production Readiness

### Enterprise Features
- ✅ **High Availability**: Component redundancy and failover
- ✅ **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling support with load balancing
- ✅ **Security**: mTLS, authentication, and authorization integration
- ✅ **Compliance**: LGPD/GDPR compliance integration
- ✅ **Observability**: Complete telemetry with OpenTelemetry
- ✅ **Disaster Recovery**: Automated backup and restore capabilities

### Kubernetes Integration
- **Health Probes**: Native readiness and liveness probe support
- **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGTERM handling with configurable timeouts
- **Resource Management**: CPU/memory limits and requests
- **Config Management**: ConfigMap and Secret integration
- **Service Discovery**: Native Kubernetes service integration

### CI/CD Integration
- **Automated Deployments**: GitHub Actions pipeline integration
- **Security Scanning**: SAST, dependency, and container scanning

## Usage Examples

### Health Check Integration
```bash
# Check overall health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Kubernetes probes
curl http://localhost:8080/ready
curl http://localhost:8080/live
```

### Deployment Automation
```go
// Create a deployment operation
deployment, err := deploymentAutomation.Deploy(ctx, "v2.1.0")
if err != nil {
    log.Error("Deployment failed", "error", err)
}
```

### Operations Management  
```go
// Create maintenance operation
operation, err := operationsManager.CreateOperation(
    lifecycle.OperationMaintenance,
    "System Maintenance",
    "Routine system maintenance tasks",
    parameters,
    steps,
)
```
