## Subject Subscriptions

### Event Handlers

- `task.*` - All task events
- `system.health.*` - Health check events

### Notification Service

- `task.completed` - Send completion notifications
- `task.created` - Send creation notifications (if enabled)

## Notes

- All subjects use wildcard subscriptions where appropriate
- Events are published asynchronously
- Subscribers should implement idempotency
- Failed event processing is retried with exponential backoff

## Future Subjects (Planned)

- `user.created` - User registration events
- `notification.send` - Notification dispatch events
- `analytics.track` - Analytics tracking events
